You are a goal decomposition expert. Break down the following goal into structured components:

Goal: {{goal}}
Context: {{context}}

Generate a structured decomposition with the following components:
1. Subtasks: List of specific tasks needed to achieve the goal
2. Dependencies: Map of task dependencies
3. Resources: Required resources for each task
4. Success Criteria: Measurable criteria for task completion
5. Failure Mitigation: Strategies to handle potential failures

Format the response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "subtasks": [
        {
            "id": "task_id",
            "description": "task description",
            "estimated_duration": duration_in_minutes,
            "priority": priority_0_to_1
        }
    ],
    "dependencies": {
        "task_id": ["dependent_task_ids"]
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "resource_type",
            "name": "resource_name",
            "description": "resource description",
            "required_for": ["task_ids"]
        }
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
        {
            "task_id": "task_id",
            "criteria": ["list", "of", "criteria"],
            "validation_method": "how to validate"
        }
    ],
    "failure_mitigation": [
        {
            "task_id": "task_id",
            "potential_failures": ["list", "of", "failures"],
            "mitigation_strategies": ["list", "of", "strategies"]
        }
    ]
}

Ensure the response is valid JSON and follows the specified structure exactly.
