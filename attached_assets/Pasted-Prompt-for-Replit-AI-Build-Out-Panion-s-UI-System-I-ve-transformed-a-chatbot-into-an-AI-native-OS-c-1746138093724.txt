Prompt for Replit AI: Build Out Panion’s UI System
I’ve transformed a chatbot into an AI-native OS called Panion, where modular agents live in draggable, resizable windows (like Clara, Notes, Memory Map). Now I want to fully build out the user interface to feel like a polished, transparent operating system — emotionally intelligent like Clara, but modular and visual like Manul. Please help me:

✅ Refine and polish the window system:

Add framer-motion animations when windows open/close/focus

Make z-index focus smoother and more intuitive

Style the window header to include icon, title, and a close/minimize button

🖥️ Add a fixed or toggleable side panel called “Clara’s Computer”:

This shows live logs of Clara’s internal thoughts, memory accesses, and decisions

Create a ClaraSystemLog.tsx component that uses Zustand to display logs like:

🧠 “Thinking about user prompt”

📂 “Accessed memory: user’s morning routine”

⚙️ “Action: Opening GoalPlannerAgent”

🌈 Add a ThemeContext with Tailwind support:

Light, Dark, and Dream modes

Clara can change the theme by command

Save user theme to localStorage

🧠 Add a transparent Context Panel for Clara:

Show what memory she’s referencing, current goal, and tone (emoji: 🤔/❤️)

Display this info live under the orb or in a floating window

🧰 Expand the Taskbar:

Show icons for all agents (Clara, Notes, Memory Map, etc.)

Let user right-click to minimize, pin, or close agents

Optional: add “+” button to launch new agents from a registry

🧩 Add a Command Palette (Cmd + K):

User can type “Open Notes” or “Start Dream Mode”

Clara’s suggested actions show up here too

📄 Create a /landing route as a marketing page:

Soft gradient hero section with Clara’s orb glowing

Feature list (Clara, Modular Agents, Dream Mode, Memory)

Call to action: “Launch Panion”, “Join waitlist”, or “Sign in”

💾 Persist layout:

Save open agents, window positions, and theme on reload using Zustand middleware or localStorage

Please structure everything with folders:

components/ for UI (Orb, SystemLog, Window, Taskbar)

agents/ for apps like ClaraAgent.tsx and NotesAgent.tsx

state/ for Zustand stores

contexts/ for ThemeContext and others
