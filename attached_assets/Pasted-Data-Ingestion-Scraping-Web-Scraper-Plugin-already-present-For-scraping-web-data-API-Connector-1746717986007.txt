Code Analysis Plugin: For static code analysis, documentation generation, etc.
Data Analysis Plugin: For statistical analysis, pattern detection, and reporting.
4. Automation & Orchestration
Task Scheduler Plugin: For scheduling and running tasks at intervals or on triggers.
Workflow Orchestrator Plugin: For chaining plugins together into workflows or pipelines.
5. Communication & Notification
Email Plugin: For sending notifications or reports via email.
Chatbot/Slack Plugin: For interacting with users or teams via chat platforms.
6. Storage & Export

Recommended Next Steps
Prioritize Plugins: Start with the plugins that will unlock the most value for your use case (e.g., API connector, data cleaning, and export).
Standardize Plugin Interface: Ensure all plugins follow a common interface for easy orchestration.
Add Plugin Discovery: Make it easy to add/remove plugins dynamically.
Logging & Monitoring Plugin: For system health, error tracking, and metrics.

Summary:
You already have a good foundation. To be more like Manus, focus on plugins for data ingestion, processing, analysis, automation, communication, storage, and security. This will make your system modular, extensible, and ready for a front end.
Would you like a sample directory structure or code template for any of these plugins?
yes could you start adding some of these
